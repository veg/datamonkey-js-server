/**
 * patristic.js — pairwise tree distances and Max-PD taxon selection.
 *
 * This is the first half of the AxoMEME preprocessing port, and the half that CAN be made
 * bit-identical to the Python reference. It is plain float arithmetic over a tree walk: no
 * eigendecomposition, no library-version-dependent LAPACK, nothing whose result is only unique up to
 * a sign. That is why it comes first — it establishes the parity harness on the part of the pipeline
 * where a mismatch is unambiguously a bug rather than a convention difference.
 *
 * THE REFERENCE (predict_regression_nexus.py:895-965, 1164-1188):
 *   d(a, b) = rootDist(a) + rootDist(b) - 2 * rootDist(lca(a, b))
 * computed over root distances accumulated as `current_dist + (child.branch_length or 0.0)`.
 *
 * ONE DELIBERATE DIVERGENCE, AND IT CHANGES NO RESULT. The reference materialises the full N x N
 * matrix before Max-PD (`D_full = np.zeros((N_full, N_full))`). Max-PD is a farthest-point traversal
 * that only ever reads ONE ROW per iteration, so this port computes rows on demand: `max_species + 1`
 * rows instead of N^2 cells. For a 5,000-taxon submission that is ~10 MB instead of ~100 MB, which is
 * the difference between running in a browser tab and not. The selected taxa are identical because
 * the values are identical — only the cells that are never read go uncomputed.
 *
 * NEGATIVE DISTANCES ARE PRESERVED, NOT CLAMPED. DM3's own NJ emits negative branch lengths and 5% of
 * real DM3 trees carry one at or past -0.1; the Python inference path throws on those rather than
 * degrading. Clamping here would convert a loud failure into a quiet wrong answer. See
 * src/lib/utils/treeSanitation.js for the measurement and the crash site.

 * TWO BEHAVIOURS REPRODUCED ON PURPOSE, BOTH OF WHICH LOOK LIKE BUGS:
 *
 *   1. THE SEED IS ALWAYS INDEX 0 — the first taxon in alignment order, not the most divergent one
 *      and not a deterministic function of the tree. Reordering the sequences in an upload changes
 *      which 512 taxa the model sees. That is what the model was fine-tuned against, so this port
 *      matches it; it is not a defect this layer gets to fix.
 *
 *   2. A SELECTED TAXON CAN REPEAT. Every selected index has minDist 0 (its own distance to itself
 *      enters the running minimum), so once every remaining candidate is also at 0 — an all-zero
 *      distance matrix, i.e. a tree whose branch lengths are all zero — argmax returns index 0 over
 *      and over and the same taxon fills every slot. `duplicates` reports it rather than silently
 *      deduplicating, because deduplicating would change which taxa reach a model that was trained
 *      with the duplicates present.
 *
 * @param {any} tree
