/**
 * modelContract.js — what the AxoMEME 2.0 ONNX graph accepts and returns.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS, AND WHY IT IS CODE RATHER THAN A README.
 *
 * The exported graph is the MODEL ONLY. It takes five already-computed tensors and returns five;
 * the entire preprocessing pipeline that produces those tensors — newick parse, patristic
 * distances, taxon subsampling, codon/AA tokenisation, and the MDS eigendecomposition — is NOT in
 * the graph and has to be rebuilt in JS. `mds_coords` is a graph INPUT, not something the graph
 * computes. (`torch.linalg.eigh` has no ONNX lowering, so this is forced rather than chosen:
 * exporting the identical module with eigh removed succeeds and with it present fails.)
 *
 * That means every number below is a place a JS port can be silently, plausibly wrong — producing
 * a well-formed tensor of the right shape that means something different from what the model was
 * trained on. Several of them are genuinely surprising, so they are constants here with citations
 * rather than assumptions in someone's head:
 *
 *   - CODON ORDER IS "TCAG", NOT ALPHABETICAL. The vocabulary is built as
 *     `[a+b+c for a in "TCAG" for b in "TCAG" for c in "TCAG"]`, the standard genetic-code table
 *     order. An ACGT-ordered vocabulary is a perfectly valid-looking permutation of the same 64
 *     tokens and would be wrong at every site. THE HANDOFF'S OWN INFERENCE DRIVER GETS THIS WRONG —
 *     see the next paragraph before "correcting" anything here to match it.
 *
 * THE DRIVER'S TOKENIZER DISAGREES WITH THE TRAINING TOKENIZER. This is measured, not suspected.
 *
 *   train_transformer_selection.py:74-85  (TRAINING)  64 codons, TCAG order, '-'->64, '?'->65
 *   predict_regression_nexus.py:49-80     (INFERENCE) 60 codons, ALPHABETICAL, everything else ->65
 *
 * The driver defines its own `CODON_LIST` / `CODON_TO_IDX` at lines 49-55, then redefines
 * `get_codon_token` at line 74 — but never redefines `CODON_TO_IDX`, so the winning function looks up
 * the 60-codon alphabetical map. It imports only `PhyloAxialTransformer`,
 * `compute_mds_coordinates` and `decode_soft_ordinal_lrt` from the training module (line 28), so the
 * training tokenizer is never in scope. Result, checked over all 64 codons:
 *
 *   63 of 64 codons receive a DIFFERENT token at inference than at training
 *     ATG: train 35 -> inference 14      TTT: train  0 -> inference 59
 *     AAA: train 42 -> inference  0      GGG: train 63 -> inference 42
 *   TTA (Leucine) and all three stop codons are ABSENT from the driver's list entirely, so they
 *   collapse to 65 "unknown" — real leucine data is discarded rather than mistokenised.
 *   The amino-acid stream is nearly intact: 3 of 64 wrong, the stops, because the driver's
 *   GENETIC_CODE writes them as '_' while AA_LIST contains '*', so they land on 22 instead of 20.
 *
 * DM3 USES THE TRAINING VOCABULARY, which is what this file pins. A model trained on TCAG-64 has to
 * be served TCAG-64; there is no reading under which the driver's map is the right one for these
 * weights. Reproducing the driver here would reproduce a bug.
 *
 * Note what this does NOT invalidate: the ML team's ONNX-vs-PyTorch parity result. That test feeds
 * the same tensors to both sides, so it proves the graph was exported faithfully and is unaffected
 * by which tokenizer produced those tensors. The bug is invisible to it by construction — which is
 * exactly why it survived to here.
 *   - GAP AND UNKNOWN ARE DIFFERENT TOKENS, and they differ between the two streams: codons use
 *     64/65, amino acids use 21/22. They are not interchangeable — `forward()` gates on
 *     `(c_cent < 64) & (a_cent < 21)`, so a gap counts as invalid at the central site.
 *   - MDS IS COMPUTED ON THE PADDED MATRIX. `compute_mds_coordinates` is handed the full
 *     [max_species, max_species] tensor, zeros included, so the padded region participates in the
 *     double-centring and the coordinates depend on max_species — not just on the real taxa. A port
 *     that runs MDS on the N real species and pads afterwards gets different numbers.
 *   - THE TWO PHYLO TENSORS ARE SITE-INVARIANT. dist_matrix and mds_coords are
 *     computed once and `expand`ed across sites. They are per-alignment, not per-site, which is what
 *     makes batching every site into one graph run cheap.
 *
 * Sources, all in the ML team's handoff (axomeme-2.0-viral-handoff/scripts/):
 *   predict_regression_nexus.py:161-187   compute_mds_coordinates
 *   predict_regression_nexus.py:1213-1229 tensor allocation, pad tokens, MDS on the padded matrix
 *   predict_regression_nexus.py:1271-1275 the site-invariant expands
 *   predict_regression_nexus.py:981-982   window_size / max_species defaults
 *   train_transformer_selection.py:73-97  codon + amino acid vocabularies
 *   forward(msa_codons, msa_aas, dist_matrix, mds_coords)  — four inputs in v1-viral
 *
 * This module is deliberately a LEAF: it imports nothing, computes nothing, and holds no model. It
 * describes and it validates. Nothing here should ever pull in onnxruntime-web — the runtime is
 * loaded on the AxoMEME path only, and the reachability guard in
 * src/test/meme-hit-likelihood.test.js exists to keep that true.

/**
 * The single graph output. RESOLVED against the artifact itself — read out of the ONNX graph on
 * axomeme_v1_viral_finetuned.onnx (sha256 de765904…ccda3), not from documentation. The ML team's
 * own dev doc lists four inputs in its table while its prose says five; the table is correct for
 * this export and the prose is left over from 2.0.
 *
 * THE EXPORT IS EVAL MODE. This was an open question worth recording, because the shipped driver
 * switches the module to `model.train()` before every forward pass purely to reach the branch that
 * returns RAW ORDINAL LOGITS, so it can apply `--prior_shift` and call `decode_soft_ordinal_lrt`
 * itself (predict_regression_nexus.py:1354-1366). The answer is that the graph took the EVAL branch:
 * five outputs, `lrt` already decoded. Two consequences for the JS side:
 *
 *   - JS does NOT implement `decode_soft_ordinal_lrt`. The graph did it.
 *   - `prior_shift` is baked to 0 and is not reachable. If a calibration shift is ever wanted, it has
 *     to be re-exported, not applied here.
 *
 * STILL OPEN, and it belongs to POSTPROCESSING rather than to this contract: the driver applies
 * `np.expm1` to alpha / beta_neg / beta_pos before writing its CSV. Those heads are `F.softplus(...)`,
 * and expm1(softplus(x)) == exp(x), so the model is predicting log1p(rate) and expm1 recovers the
 * rate — meaning the raw graph outputs are NOT rates and must not be shown as such. `p_neg` is
 * sigmoid in-graph and is already a probability. Whether `lrt` needs a further exp is unresolved: the
 * driver emits both `predicted_log_lrt` and `predicted_lrt` columns, and which one this output
 * corresponds to has to be checked against sample_predictions.csv before anything is rendered.
